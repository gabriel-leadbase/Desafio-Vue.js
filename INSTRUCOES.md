## Questions & Answers 

<p>Q: Why i use CDN?</p>

<p>A: I am not used to the vue ecosystem.</p>

<p>Q: Why this application don't have a local storage or any other methods?</p>

<p>A: Unfortunately at first I couldn't understand the method who storage functions, so I left it as a sercundary feature(I'll implement it in the next update).</p>

<p>Q: You have many css files, and some empty, why did you leave them even though you know there is nothing?</p>

<p>A: They're very useful, the css file separation makes maintenance much easier, but css was left as a secondary implementation.</p>

<p>A: I was trying to do as much as better, but those are harder for me, and i couldn't do it everything on time.</p>
